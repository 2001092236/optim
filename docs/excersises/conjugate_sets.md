# Conjugate sets

1. Prove, that $$S^* = \left(\overline{S}\right)^*$$
1. Prove, that $$\left( \mathbf{conv}(S) \right)^* = S^*$$
1. Prove, that if $$B(0,r)$$ is a ball of radius $$r$$ at some norm with the center in zero, then $$\left( B(0,r) \right)^* = B(0,1/r)$$
1. Find a dual cone for a monotonous non-negative cone: 
    
    $$
    K = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid x_1 \ge x_2 \ge \ldots \ge x_n \ge 0\}
    $$

1. Find and sketch on the plane a conjugate set to a multi-faceted cone: $$S = \mathbf{cone} \{ (-3,1), (2,3), (4,5)\} $$
1. Derive the definition of the cone from the definition of the conjugate set.
1. Name any 3 non-trivial facts about conjugate sets.
1. How to write down a set conjugate to the polyhedron?
1. Draw a conjugate set by hand for simple sets. Conjugate to zero, conjugate to the halfline, to two random points, to their convex hull, etc.
1. Give examples of self-conjugate sets.
1. Using a lemma about a cone conjugate, conjugate to the sum of cones and a lemma about a cone, conjugate to the intersection of closed convex cones, prove, that cones
    
    $$
    K_1 = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid x = Ay, y \ge 0, y \in \mathbb{R}^m, A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times}, \}, \;\; K_2 = \{p \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid A^Tp \ge 0\}
    $$
    
    are self dual.
1. Find the sets $$S^{*}, S^{**}, S^{***}$$, if 
    
    $$
    S = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_1 + x_2 \ge 0, \;\; 2x_1 + x_2 \ge -4, \;\; -2x_1 + x_2 \ge -4\}
    $$

1. Find conjugate cone for the cone of positive definite (semi-definite) matrices.
1. Find the conjugate cone for the exponential cone:
    
    $$
    K = \{(x, y, z) \mid y > 0, y e^{x/y} \leq z\}
    $$

1. Prove, that's fair for closed convex cones:
    
    $$
    (K_1 \cap K_2)^* = K_1^* + K_2^*
    $$

1. Find the dual cone for the following cones:

    * \$$K = \{0\}$$
    * \$$K = \mathbb{R}^2$$
    * \$$K = \{(x_1, x_2) \mid \vert x_1\vert \leq x_2\}$$
    * \$$K = \{(x_1, x_2) \mid x_1 + x_2 = 0\}$$
