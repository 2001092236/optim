* Show, that these conditions are equivivalent:

$$ \|\nabla f(x) - \nabla f(z)\|\le L\|x-z\| $$

and

$$ f(z) \le f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T(z-x) + \frac L 2 \|z-x\|^2 $$

* Give an example of a function, that satisfies Polyak Lojasiewicz condition, but doesn't have convexity property.
* Prove, that if $g(x)$ - convex function, then $f(x) = g(x) + \dfrac{\lambda}{2}\\|x\\|^2_2$ will be strongly convex function
