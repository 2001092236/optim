## Principles

* This site aims on researchers and enthisiasts with some prior expertise in the field (not the Wikipedia clone)
* The fundamental primitive structure of this site is the page
* The page should consist short self-sufficient material about the topic
* If the page is based on paper, bibtex label should be added at the beginning
* The general structure of the site is flexible and should be improved over the time iteratively

## Notations and terms

* $\theta$ -- optimizing variable
* $\mathbb{R}^p$ -- $p$ - dimensional Euclidian space
